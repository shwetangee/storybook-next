## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, you can reach out to the maintainers directly on Twitter: https://twitter.com/storybookjs

When we fix a security issue, we will post a security advisory on Github/NPM, describe the change in the [release notes](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/releases), and also announce notify the community on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/storybook).
