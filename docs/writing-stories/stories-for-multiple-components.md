title: 'Stories for multiple components'
---

It's useful to write stories that [render two or more components](../writing-stories/introduction.md#stories-for-two-or-more-components) at once if those components are designed to work together. For example, `ButtonGroups`, `Lists`, and `Page` components.

## Reusing subcomponent stories

The simplest approach we can take is to reuse the stories of the `ListItem` in the `List`:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'react/list-story-unchecked.js.mdx',
    'react/list-story-unchecked.ts.mdx',
    'vue/list-story-unchecked.2.js.mdx',
    'vue/list-story-unchecked.2.ts.mdx',
    'vue/list-story-unchecked.3.js.mdx',
    'vue/list-story-unchecked.3.ts.mdx',
    'angular/list-story-unchecked.ts.mdx',
    'web-components/list-story-unchecked.js.mdx',
    'web-components/list-story-unchecked.ts.mdx',
  ]}
  usesCsf3
  csf2Path="writing-stories/stories-for-multiple-components#snippet-list-story-unchecked"
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

By rendering the `Unchecked` story with its args, we are able to reuse the input data from the `ListItem` stories in the `List`.

However, we still aren’t using args to control the `ListItem` stories, which means we cannot change them with controls and we cannot reuse them in other, more complex component stories.

## Using children as an arg

One way we improve that situation is by pulling the rendered subcomponent out into a `children` arg:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'react/list-story-with-unchecked-children.js.mdx',
    'react/list-story-with-unchecked-children.ts.mdx',
  ]}
  usesCsf3
  csf2Path="writing-stories/stories-for-multiple-components#snippet-list-story-with-unchecked-children"
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Now that `children` is an arg, we can potentially reuse it in another story.

However, there are some caveats when using this approach that you should be aware of.

The `children` `args` as any other arg needs to be JSON serializable. It means that you should:

- Avoid using empty values
- Use caution with components that include third party libraries

As they could lead into errors with your Storybook.

<div class="aside">

We're currently working on improving the overall experience for the children arg and allow you to edit children arg in a control and allow you to use other types of components in the near future. But for now you need to factor in this caveat when you're implementing your stories.

</div>

## Creating a Template Component

Another option that is more “data”-based is to create a special “story-generating” template component:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'react/list-story-template.js.mdx',
    'react/list-story-template.ts.mdx',
    'vue/list-story-template.2.js.mdx',
    'vue/list-story-template.2.ts.mdx',
    'vue/list-story-template.3.js.mdx',
    'vue/list-story-template.3.ts.mdx',
    'angular/list-story-template.ts.mdx',
    'web-components/list-story-template.js.mdx',
    'web-components/list-story-template.ts.mdx',
  ]}
  usesCsf3
  csf2Path="writing-stories/stories-for-multiple-components#snippet-list-story-template"
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This approach is a little more complex to setup, but it means you can more easily reuse the `args` to each story in a composite component. It also means that you can alter the args to the component with the Controls addon.
