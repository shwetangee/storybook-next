To use auto-detected controls with Angular, you must fill in the `component` field in your story metadata:

```ts
import { Button } from './button.component';

export default {
  title: 'Button',
  component: Button,
};
```

Storybook uses this to auto-generate the `ArgTypes` for your component using [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/). It supports `inputs`, `outputs`, `properties`, `methods`, `view/content child/children` as first class prop types.

## Automatic Compodoc setup

During `sb init`, you will be asked, whether you want to setup Compodoc for your project. Just answer the question with Yes. Compodoc is then ready to use!

## Manual Compodoc setup

You'll need to register Compodoc's `documentation.json` file in `.storybook/preview.ts`:

```js
import { setCompodocJson } from '@storybook/addon-docs/angular';
import docJson from '../documentation.json';

setCompodocJson(docJson);
```

Finally, to set up compodoc, you'll first need to install Compodoc:

```sh
yarn add -D @compodoc/compodoc
```

Then you'll need to configure Compodoc to generate a `documentation.json` file. Adding the following snippet to your `projects.<project>.architect.<storybook|build-storybook>` in the `angular.json` creates a metadata file `./documentation.json` each time you run storybook:

```jsonc
// angular.json
{
  "projects": {
    "your-project": {
      "architect": {
        "storybook": {
          ...,
          "compodoc": true,
          "compodocArgs": [
            "-e",
            "json",
            "-d",
            "." // the root folder of your project
          ],
        },
        "build-storybook": {
          ...,
          "compodoc": true,
          "compodocArgs": [
            "-e",
            "json",
            "-d",
            "." // the root folder of your project
          ],
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Unfortunately, it's not currently possible to update this dynamically as you edit your components, but [there's an open issue](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/8672) to support this with improvements to Compodoc.
