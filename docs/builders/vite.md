Storybook Vite builder bundles your components and stories with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast ESM bundler.

- For applications built with Vite: it allows reusing the existing configuration in Storybook.
- For applications built with Webpack: it provides faster startup and refresh times, with the disadvantage that your component's execution environment differs from your application.

## Setup

If you ran `npx storybook init` to include Storybook in your Vite application, the builder is already installed and configured for you. If you want, you can also opt into it manually.

Run the following command to install the builder.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/storybook-vite-builder-install.yarn.js.mdx',
    'common/storybook-vite-builder-install.npm.js.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<div class="aside">

ℹ️ Installing the package with `@next` will install the cutting-edge version of it. Be advised prerelease versions are subject to breaking changes and are not recommended for production use. Use at your own risk.

</div>

Update your Storybook configuration (in `.storybook/main.js|ts`) to include the builder.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/storybook-vite-builder-register.js.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Configuration

Out of the box, Storybook's Vite builder includes a set of configuration defaults for the supported frameworks, which are merged alongside your existing configuration file. For an optimal experience when using the Vite builder, we recommend applying any configuration directly inside Vite's configuration file (i.e., [`vite.config.js`](https://vitejs.dev/config/)).

When Storybook loads, it automatically merges the configuration into its own. However, not all projects have the same requirements, and you may need to provide a custom configuration created specifically for Storybook. In that case, you can adjust your configuration file (.storybook/main.js|ts) and add the `viteFinal` configuration function as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/storybook-vite-builder-aliasing.js.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The asynchronous function `viteFinal` receives a `config` object with the default builder configuration and returns the updated configuration.

You can also override the builder's configuration based on the environment. For instance, if you need to provide a custom configuration for development purposes and another for production, you can extend the default configuration as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/storybook-vite-builder-config-env.js.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### TypeScript

If you need, you can also configure Storybook's Vite builder using TypeScript. Rename your `.storybook/main.js` to `.storybook/main.ts` and adjust it as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/storybook-vite-builder-ts-configure.ts.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Troubleshooting

### Working directory not being detected

By default, the Vite builder enables Vite's [`server.fs.strict`](https://vitejs.dev/config/#server-fs-strict) option for increased security, defining the project's `root` to Storybook's configuration directory
If you need to override it, you can use the `viteFinal` function and adjust it.

### ArgTypes are not generated automatically

Currently, [automatic argType inference](../api/argtypes.md#automatic-argtype-inference) is only available for React, Vue3 and Svelte (JSDocs only). With React, the Vite builder defaults to `react-docgen-typescript` if TypeScript is listed as a dependency. If you run into any issues, you can revert to `react-docgen` by updating your Storybook configuration file as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/storybook-vite-builder-react-docgen.js.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
