- Add the `--type vue` (for Vue 2), or `--type vue3` (for Vue 3) flag to the installation command to set up Storybook manually:

  ```shell
  # For Vue 2 projects
  npx storybook init --type vue

  # For Vue 3 projects
  npx storybook init --type vue3
  ```

- Storybook's CLI provides support for [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package managers. If you have Yarn installed in your environment but prefer to use another as your default package manager add the `--package-manager` flag to your installation command. For example:

  ```shell
  npx storybook init --package-manager=npm
  ```
