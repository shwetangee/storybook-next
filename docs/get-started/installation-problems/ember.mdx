  ```

- During the install process, if you get the following warning message:

  ```shell

  For more details, use ember help.
  ```

Update the [`@storybook/ember-cli-storybook`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/ember-cli-storybook) package to the latest version to fix it.

- Storybook's CLI provides support for [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package managers. If you have Yarn installed in your environment but prefer to use another as your default package manager add the `--package-manager` flag to your installation command. For example:

  ```shell
  npx storybook init --package-manager=npm
  ```

- For other installation issues, check the [Ember README](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/frameworks/ember) for additional instructions.
