- Add the `--type qwik` flag to the installation command to set up Storybook manually:

  ```shell
  npx storybook init --type qwik
  ```

- Storybook's CLI provides support for [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package managers. If you have Yarn installed in your environment but prefer to use another as your default package manager add the `--package-manager` flag to your installation command. For example:

  ```shell
  npx storybook init --package-manager=npm
  ```
