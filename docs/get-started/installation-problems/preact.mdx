- Add the `--type preact` flag to the installation command to set up Storybook manually:

  ```shell
  npx storybook init --type preact
  ```

- Storybook's CLI provides support for [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package managers. If you have Yarn installed in your environment but prefer to use another as your default package manager add the `--package-manager` flag to your installation command. For example:

  ```shell
  npx storybook init --package-manager=npm
  ```

- For other installation issues, check the [Preact README](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/frameworks/preact-webpack5) for additional instructions.
